# ABOUT Exoplanets Tool

This [Shiny][1] application is my Project for the [Coursera's][3] Course  "[Developing Data Products][2]".

It aims to provide a tool to help people exploring exoplanets data from different points of view and should be considered just as a first version model.

Exoplanets data has been obtained from [Open Exoplanet Catalogue][4] - [github repo][5], an open source database of all discovered extrasolar planets:

*The Open Exoplanet Catalogue is a catalogue of all discovered extra-solar planets. It is a new kind of astronomical database. It is decentralized and completely open. We welcome contributions and corrections from both professional astronomers and the general public.*

[Wikipedia on Exoplanets][6]:

"An **exoplanet** or **extrasolar planet** is a planet that does not orbit the Sun and instead orbits a different star, stellar remnant, or brown dwarf. More than 1800 exoplanets have been discovered (1890 planets in 1189 planetary systems including 477 multiple planetary systems as of 17 February 2015)."
